[1] The group exercises will consist of a “past-facing” workshop which will allow participants to “go back” to the point in time in which their discontinued civic tech projects have started, and then consider what could have been done to make different outputs,outcomes, and impacts. In the group discussion, we will connect the discussion of failure with a speculative approach that helps participants learn for future initiatives and cases. Discussion will be organized by a team of co-organizers who have experience in speculative methods and working with civic tech practitioners. In this way, we can contribute insights from the field, novel concepts to speak of failure as a part of a learning trajectory in HCI, and assumptions about the present, past, and future of design for civic tech in HCI.

[2] Exercises may be organized in smaller thematic groups, in this case, participants are divided into groups based on their submitted “failure” stories, e.g., regarding stakeholders, goals, funding, and evaluation criteria. According to the participants’ plans to participate in person or online, we may move some groups to the virtual space.
