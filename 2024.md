# The 2st Workshop of Discontinued Civic Tech

### Thank you for participating in our workshop!

Upon our success in holding <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/history/2023/2023">the CHI’23 Workshop “Failed yet successful –Learning from discontinued civic tech initiatives,”</a> we decided not to discontinue our workshop format. This year, we are holding the workshop online and at the University of Tokyo, Japan, bridging researchers and practitioners around the world. This workshop will provide academics and practitioners with an opportunity to exchange experiences and insights on discontinued civic tech initiatives. The goal of the workshop is to develop a better understanding of why some civic tech initiatives seemingly ‘fail’ and ask whether discontinued initiatives may still somehow contribute to social change and the growth of digital civics. Further we would like to learn from long-living  initiatives’ experiences. A variety of sub-questions around discontinued civic tech will be addressed in the workshop, including matters of participation, citizen science, civic design, public management, power structures and biases, and communication.
